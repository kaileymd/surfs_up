# Will Island Temperatures Support Surfing & Ice Cream Shop Business Model
This analysis will assist with determining if a dual surfing and ice cream shop is viable on the island of Oahu. After analyzing the potential of such a shop during the peak season, June, we will also determine if the ice cream shop will be able to stay open year-round by looking at temperatures in December.

## Summary
Luckily for this analysis, the count of temperatures between June and December and the data's standard deviations are similar enough to make their results comparable. The temperature range for June is between 64 and 85 degrees, whereas for December the range is between 56 and 83 degrees.
- The median temperature for June is 75 degrees and is 71 degrees for December - a difference of only 4 degrees. This separation is true for the first quartile as well, meaning that 75% of the temperature data for June and December are very similar to each other.
- This is also validated by the mean temperature, which is 75 degrees for June and 71 degrees for December. 
- The coldest day in June was 64 degrees, whereas the coldest day in December was 56 degrees.  This indicates that for all except the coldest days in December, the surfing and ice cream traffic should be comparable.

## Conclusion
Now that the temperatures have been established as suitable year-round for the desirability of ice cream, ideal surfing conditions need to be taken into account. To further this analysis, I would:
- Research preferred surfing conditions and query the database for monthly precipitation and wind speeds to see if the weather would pull surfers to the area or not.
- Expand queried stations to the other Hawaiian islands to see if this shop idea would be more suited to another island, or if it could become a chain.
